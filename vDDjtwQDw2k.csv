@duke_adi,"At 2:24:00 hrs, professor asks about the possibility for some heights or widths going beyond 400, the most easy solution could be fault in the user's code where instead of 400 height and width, the user accidentally filled a bigger value!"

@meganova609,2:35:15 just pass the nearestSample it got all the value
@MDPg159,"It's not really ""Without Libraries"" if you're using Javascript. Scripting languages, in a way, are completely dependent and founded on the use of libraries. This can be seen by the complete lack of portability of the program. Furthermore, the use of a literal library is also not really ""Without Libraries"" either"

@cosmicwitness3390,bro please do this python js code makes my head hurt and i think python makes the code more readable and easy to follow
@kimberlywhite8399,"Sir, I need help on this because the canvas doesn't show up"
@leroyparker,"This is fantastic.  I've been following along, keystroke for keystroke all day today, 5 hours to reach the 54 min mark - I pause a lot to double check everything.  Unfortunately, I've hit a wall and I think it might be a Mac thing.  When trying to run the dataset_generator for the first time, about 54:30 in the video, it throws an ""unexpected token    in JSON at position 0"" (two spaces after 'token"" implying a null/undefined value there).  figured I'd share this in case, 1) someone else has worked through it, and 2) you might not have received much feedback from mac users if your students are a PC clan.

In any event, I'll eventually debug this, I'm just so thankful for you and this content.  Please keep up the good work."

@RaymondJohnsonM,"I was following allong with the Javascript segment and ran into a problem where even after ""this.paths"" was consistent throughout the sketchpad, there was a problem with 'this.paths.push' still not being defined. As it turned out, it was chicken and egg problem with the array definition not have a valid array entry value, and thus being considered empty, and therefore, undefined. I was able to resolve this issue this this code:

<<<    #addEventListeners(){
        this.canvas.onmousedown = (evt) => {
            const mouse = this.#getMouse(evt);
            this.currentPath = [mouse]; // Start a new path with the starting point
            this.isDrawing = true;
        };
    
        this.canvas.onmousemove = (evt) => {
            if (this.isDrawing) {
                const mouse = this.#getMouse(evt);
                this.currentPath.push(mouse); // Add points to the current path
                this.#redraw();
            }
        };
    
        this.canvas.onmouseup = () => {
            if (this.currentPath && this.currentPath.length) {
                this.paths.push(this.currentPath); // Save the completed path
            }
            this.currentPath = null; // Reset the current path
            this.isDrawing = false;
        };
    }
    

    #redraw(){
        this.ctx.clearRect(0, 0, this.canvas.width, this.canvas.height);
        draw.paths(this.ctx, this.paths);
        if (this.currentPath && this.currentPath.length) {

@justdoeverything8883,"This is an awesome course, but I just want to add, so many of the little annoyances on the drawing app can be avoided by using pointerevents, which work for touch and mouse events, and allow you to capture the event instead of having to put the listener on the document itself."

@celenial6009,I havent watched yet but can tell by the comments that you are a great teacher
@_yllw6155,"Is there any specific reason or benefit he doesn't use spaces when assigning variables, declaring conditionals, or creating for loops? Is it simply preference?

I think most people (including me) would write like this:

const foo = 'bar';

for (let i = 0; i < baz.length; i++) {
...
}

but he writes like this (and I've seen some others):

const foo='bar';

for (let i=0;i<baz.length;i++) {

@aldonunes,"It happened to me that when I touched the screen and dragged my finger, the whole screen and the canvas were dragged together (28 min.).

I saw that this is the default behavior. So I just added a ""preventDefault();"" to functions associated with events.

Code:
this.canvas.ontouchstart = (and) => {
   e.preventDefault();
   const loc = e.touches[0];
   this.canvas.onmousedown(loc);
}

this.canvas.ontouchmove = (and) => {

   const loc = e.touches[0];

@pacoescriba470,"please,  could you left the code in some place? My code is apparently exactly as your code, but it doesn't run correctly."
@kelvinclark3474,you can change all the onmouse*** to onpointer*** to not set the ontouch*** events. THe onpointer**** registers the event for both mouse and touch.
@fahad_hassan_92,The Drawing App is easy to understand but how are we supposed to come up with stuff like that? 10 years of experience in computer science? lol
@fahad_hassan_92,"20:56 Can someone explain what he has done here? Why create a const draw with the curly brackets and what is draw.path? You can also just tell me the topic name if you don't want to explain here, I can do research on it myself then"

@parsonsmarcus,"Just as a quick aside in the beginning part, if you set the content type to ""text/plain"" in the data string, you may run into issues when downloading file data because the browser thinks it should be a .txt file. If you instead set the content type to be ""application/json"", it will download just fine without a warning. Like so: ""data:application/json;charset=utf-8""

Chrome warned me on MacOS whenever I wanted to download this file with a .json extension that had a content type of text/plain."
@godlikemouse,"Hi Radu, I just finished the first part of the course.  Great so far, thank you.  You asked if there was a better way to handle the download anchor click.  I'd like to suggest the following:

const element = document.createElement(""a"");
element.setAttribute(
    ""href"",
     ""data:text/plain;charset=utf-8,"" +
         encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(data))
);

const fileName = data.session + "".json"";
element.setAttribute(""download"", fileName);
element.click();

There shouldn't be any need to actually inject the anchor into the document.  You can simply create the element and invoke the click directly in memory.  Hope this helps :)"

@papatangovictor,Machine learning is not a metaphysical abstraction that will allow machines to dominate humanity. Which is already dominated by the interests of large corporations that have governments in their pockets. Technically it's just fine-tuned probability based on sophisticated code and a lot of processing power. And this guy is a root programmer with excellent teaching skills.
